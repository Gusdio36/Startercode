      The Biden administration has approved the massive Willow oil 
      drilling project in Alaska, angering climate advocates and 
      setting the stage for a court challenge.</p>
    <p>The Willow Project is a decadeslong oil drilling venture 
      in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is owned by the 
      federal government. The area where the project is planned 
      holds up to 600 million barrels of oil, though that oil would 
      take years to reach the market since the project has yet to be constructed.</p>
    <p>By the administration's own estimates, the project would generate enough 
      oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution 
      a year - equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads.</p>
    <p>The approval is a victory for Alaska's bipartisan congressional 
      delegation and a coalition of Alaska Native tribes and groups who hailed 
      the drilling venture as a much-needed new source of revenue and jobs for t
      he remote region.</p>
    <p>“We finally did it, Willow is finally reapproved, and we can almost 
      literally feel Alaska's future brightening because of it,” Republican Sen. 
      Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said in a statement, adding that Alaska is 
      “now on the cusp of creating thousands of new jobs, generating billions 
      of dollars in new revenues” and “improving quality of life on the North 
      Slope and across our state.”</p>
    <p>“After years of consistent, determined advocacy for this project,
       from people all across the state and from every walk of life, 
       the Willow Project is finally moving forward,” said Democratic Rep. 
       Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native in Congress. “I would like to 
       thank the President and his administration for listening to the voices 
       of Alaskans when it mattered most.”</p>

    <p>Nagruk Harcharek, president of the advocacy group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, 
      said in a statement Monday that his group was “grateful” to President 
      Joe Biden and his senior advisers for approving the project and “heeding 
      the will of Alaska Native communities in support of the Willow Project.”</p>
    <p>“The Willow Project is a new opportunity to ensure a viable future for our 
      communities, creating generational economic stability for our people and 
      advancing our self-determination,” Harcharek said.</p>
    <p>On Sunday, an administration official said the administration views the 
      new actions as a “firewall” against both future fossil fuel leasing and 
      expansion of existing projects on the North Slope.</p>
    <p>“The fact that this Willow [approval] comes with the announcement of 
      future legally-dubious resource development restrictions on Alaska lands 
      and waters is infuriating and demonstrates that the Biden Administration's 
      unprecedented lock-up of our state will continue,” Sullivan said in a statement.</p>
    <p>Sullivan told reporters on Monday that the Biden administration assured him that 
      the existing lease rights in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska would not be 
      affected by the new rules.</p>

    <p>Environmental groups lashed out at the Biden administration for its approval of 
      Willow and said the increased protections for other Arctic regions will not undo 
      the harm the project will cause.</p>
    <p>Tiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice president of government affairs for the League 
      of Conservation Voters, said the league is “extremely disappointed” in the decision, 
      calling the project “dangerous” and “dirty.”</p>
    <p>“This is in direct conflict with the Biden-Harris administration's goals of cutting 
      climate pollution in half by 2030, and it's now all the more important they double 
      down on executive action that maximizes climate and conservation progress,” Sittenfeld 
      said in a statement. “The new protections announced for the threatened Arctic are 
      important, but they do not make up for Willow's approval.”</p>
    <p>Lena Moffitt, the executive director of Evergreen Action, which advocates for strong 
      climate change policies, called the approval “an unacceptable departure from President 
      Biden's promises to the American people on climate and environmental justice.”</p>
